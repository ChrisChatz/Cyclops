The main idea of this thesis was to create a vehicle with an embedded Arduino Yun that connects via Wi-Fi to a computer,
from which the user can control it. The communication is between a Server (vehicle) and a Client (website).
Adding a web-Â­camera to the vehicle, enables the user to move it even if he is in a different place. At this point, it should be mentioned that communication is achieved only when the Server (vehicle) and the Client (website) are on the same network. In order to further facilitate the user, a sensor, a photoresistor (or photocell), was added.
