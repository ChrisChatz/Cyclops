The main idea of this thesis was to create a vehicle with an embedded Arduino Yun which is connected via Wi­Fi to a computer, from which the user can control it. Adding a web­camera to the vehicle, enables the user to move it even if he is in a different place. In order to further facilitate the user a photoresistor was added.
